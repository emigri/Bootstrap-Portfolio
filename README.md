# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Portfolio created using HTML, CSS and bootstrap


  Navigation bar
    For the Nav Bar I used the standard navbar bootstrap code.
    Links lead to sections of the page

  Hero section

    Used a jumbotron featuring my picture, name, and a little introduction. 

  Work section

    This section displays three bootstrap cards linking to websites that I used as inspiration for this particulart project.
    I plan to use icons to illjustrate which languages and frameworks i used in addition to a small description of my projects

  Skills section
    
    Listed the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp using bootstrap item list

  Contact section.

    An "About Me" section in the same row.
    
  Footer section.

    All hyperlinks have a hover effect.

    All buttons display a box shadow upon hover.
    
    Had no time to go through the media queries but I've tried my best to have a mobile first approach to the page in order to minimize media queries

# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Portfolio created using HTML, CSS and bootstrap


    - Navigation bar
    For the Nav Bar I used the standard navbar bootstrap code - gave placeholder links at this point as I wasn't sure how to link to sections of the page just yet.
    This section will be fixed and move down with the page as you scroll

    - hero section

   Used a jumbotron featuring my picture, name, and a little introduction. 
   I used bootstrap grid and gave it threee sections, leaving one empty so the photograph can be in the middle. The image also needs to be centred in the div but I couldn't find a way yet
   I plan to centre the intro <p> tag, give it better styling and positioning and give the section

    - work section

    This section displays three bootstrap cards linking to websites that I used as inspiration for this particulart project.
    I plan to use icons to illjustrate which languages and frameworks i used in addition to a small description of my projects
    The cards will include a screenshot of the page with JS features to make it stand out and be more interactive

    - skills section

   Listed the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp using bootstrap item list

    - Contact section.

      - An "About Me" section in the same row.
    
    - A footer section.

      - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

      - All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

5. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
    - Had no time to go through the media queries but I've tried my best to have a mobile first approach to the page in order to minimize media queries
